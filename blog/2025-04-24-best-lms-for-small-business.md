### What is an LMS

An LMS, which stands for Learning Management System, is basically a digital hub where people can create, share, and track learning or training materials. 

Think of it as an online classroom or training center. It's used by anyone from large uni's to smaller coaches, one person coaching businesses, online trainers,
personal trainers, and nearly anyone sharing learning content or resources with their clients and students. LMS's can also be used just by you to 
manage your class, be it in person or digital.

**Core Uses:**
- **Makes Learning Easy to Organise**: You can build courses, upload videos, add quizzes, and organize everything in one place.
- **Delivers** **Content** **Online**: Learners can log in from anywhere on their computer or phone to access lessons, watch videos, or take tests.
- **Track Student Progress**: The system keeps tabs on who’s completed what, how everyone is doing in for example; quizzes, and even sends reminders if someone 
falls behind.
- **Communciations**: Many LMSs have forums, chat, or messaging so students and instructors can ask questions, share ideas, or work together.

### Best Free LMS for Small Business

Some of the best LMS's that are free, are open source. Unfortunately, with everything in this life, free doesn't always mean free. Whilst the software itself
is free, the cost to implement these open sources platforms can come in hosting costs, development or configuration. They're great if you have a very large course
and need a lot of flexibility and configurability. As one [Redditer](https://www.reddit.com/r/elearning/comments/1cno11l/for_anyone_who_is_knowledgeable_about_the/) puts it:

"..real LMS systems are expensive to implement, tough to get right and require the dedication of a development and support team to help you get the most from your learning platform investment.There 
are plenty of free-ish options (WordPress. Moodle, etc.) but you trade off spending money for spending time configuring and managing the solution. You shift the cost from an LMS license fee to 
server hosting fees, sys admin costs, plugin fees, etc."

That said if you're looking for a low cost, low time/stress LMS for your small business. The best bet is via WordPress which will cost you a domain and hosting anywhere from $15+ a month.)
using a Plugin like [LifterLMS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/lifterlms/) or [LearnDash](https://www.learndash.com/)

## [LifterLMS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/lifterlms/) 

![LifterLMS](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a13abb27-e145-4ddc-9c8e-c22e1c1c23b0)


LifterLMS includes:

- **Course creator.**: Simple to use course builder with quizes, Lessions and Sections.
- **Memberships and Payments**: You can lock down your course so your students need to pay and you can collect payments via Stripe, WooCommerce or other payment gateways.You can offer 
ourses or even full site access through flexible membership options. Features include automatic enrollment, exclusive member pricing, and more. Students can pay using credit cards, 
set up recurring payments, or choose from custom pricing plans to suit their needs.
- **Student Engagement**: Keeping students motivated and satisfied is key to retention and success rates. 
With LifterLMS, you can boost engagement by awarding achievement badges, fostering social learning communities, enabling direct messaging, offering private coaching, and much more.

**Pros and Cons of LifterLMS**

LifterLMS Pros

- The drag-and-drop course builder is pretty easy to use.
- It's really great for video based lessons and has great integrations with YT and Vimeo.
- It offers lots of payment options from cards, recurring, and is highly customisble.
- The student part of the LMS has great UI and is really easy to use.
- Managing pricing and student access it pretty easy.
- Built-in analytics, certificates, and engagement triggers help you track student performance and boost motivation

LifterLMS Cons

- Costs can add up fast if you need several add-ons or advanced features. Payment gateways and email integrations are sold separately, 
and bundles can be pricey compared to other plugins like LearnDash.
- The initial setup isn’t always straightforward. Even with lots of documentation, some users find getting started a bit confusing
and wish onboarding was clearer.
- Free users get limited support, while priority is given to those with paid bundles. This can be frustrating if you run into
  issues and don’t have a paid plan.
- Some users have noticed performance slowdowns on larger sites, and there can be compatibility hiccups with certain PHP versions.
- The free version is missing many advanced features, so you’ll likely need paid extensions if you want a more complete learning platform

##  [LearnDash](https://www.learndash.com/)

![LearnDash-LMS](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b122c44-cee4-4566-a57b-2e793f567882)

Is another WordPress plugin, which is also free. That said it's limited to content and course creation, you will need to download plugins to do marketing, 
hosting videos, and to accept payments. If you're a small course creator it may work but it suffers from a similiar issue as Lifter. You'll need to stitch together 
alot of plugins and that adds complexity.

That said it's pretty simple to setu[ and use, cheap and has decent engagement and learning retention tools.

- AI course builders, assignment management, course dashboards, course dashboarhs, advanced quizes with lots of quiz question types, virtual and in person lessons and dynamic content delivery
(drip feed lessons or set linear progressions.)

LearnDash Pros

- Great for boosting student retention and course completion rates
- User-friendly interface integrated directly into the familiar WordPress dashboard
- Built-in student certification tools 
- Optional managed hosting and security services available for an additional fee
- Intuitive course builder featuring a hassle-free drag-and-drop design

LearnDash Cons

- Focuses solely on learning management, without any additional functionalities (marketing, payments etc)
- Costs can quickly add up, as essential integrations often require significant extra investment
- Does not provide video hosting or built-in payment processing capabilities
- Tracking analytics can be challenging due to reliance on multiple integrations
- Missing advanced features such as high-converting funnel templates, CRM tools, or integrated help desks
- Lacks access to a third-party marketplace for professional services

- **Content creation needs:** Assess whether you need sophisticated authoring tools or just uploading your own content.

- **Learning experience:** Determine if mobile access, gamification, or self-paced options matters to you?

- **Administrative requirements:** Consider reporting capabilities, compliance features,payments and certification tracking
