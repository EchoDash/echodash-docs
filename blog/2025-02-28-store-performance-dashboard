### What is a Dashboard?

When referring to a dashboard in software world, it is the command centre of your business. Much like a car dashboard, you see the key things speed, revs, miles travelled, oil temperature and any red flags. Unlike a car’s dashboard, you get to decide what you’re tracking. Is your north star only number of customers? Or do you need to track hot inventory and adapt your store as trends shift? A dashboard allows you to have an overview of your business without sifting through lots of data, spreadsheets or sales data. 

Your dashboard is the key thing you need to know about your business on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.


### What is a Store Performance Dashboard?

A store performance dashboard is designed specifically with stores/shops/sellers/merchants of any kind in mind. It can mean different things to different people, depending on the kind of store you run, the marketing you do, the channels you use to sell and much more. To boil it down it is a place you track your store’s entire business performance. In most cases, we’re talking e-stores and e-commerce, but even physical stores can track the important business metrics that matter. Especially if your physical store takes card payments, uses Google to advertise or uses any digital tools to run your business.

Typical things that are tracked in these dashboards, are how did your sales go this month compared to last months, or even last year? Where did the majority of your payments come from? How is the traffic to your site? Have you got bad reviews this week or month? How is your inventory, what sold well , what didn’t? Have your costs increased and has that changed your profitability? Which team member is selling most? All of these questions can be answered by a store performance dashboard.

This isn’t the limit to what can be tracked either, each business can track whatever metrics that really matter to them. There’s a lot of dashboards out there that are all built for different niches, I’ll run through some of the popular ones below.


### What Currently Exists? What are Digital Dashboard Examples?

There are a lot of dashboards out there, pretty much every payments company has their own, as do many marketing companies. For example there’s the Square Dashboard, Stripe, Shopify, WooCommerce all have their own dashboards too that track sales and revenue quite well. Same for Analytics firms like Matomo or Google Analytics, which allows you to see where traffic comes from. If you’re looking for something that can view multiple sources in one place (ie you wanna see sales data, web traffic, inventory and anything else.) There’s quite a few different providers you can try:

Klipfolio (https://klipfolio.com) has two main products one for smaller business called Klips the other, PowerMetrics is for larger companies. Both offer a suite of integrations to a suite of tools across 17 categories of software. From Ads, email to HR and Web Analytics. Their price starts from $90. They boast an easy setup, and you don’t need to be technical to get it going. Although one noted critique is it can be hard to make custom dashboards and if they don’t have the API for the tool your using you can’t view it in the dashboard.

Geckoboard (https://geckoboard.com) is a more flexible digital dashboard than Klipfolio when it comes to setting up custom dashboards, with a simple drag and drop. They also rely on integrations, with 90 data sources, of writing. Geckoboard is also well rated by those who need to share with a larger team, and for non tech savvy teams. Some of the frequent complaints users make are that the Shopify and Instagram integrations aren’t very detailed, so you don’t get top performing instagram posts or in depth sales data to visualisation in Geckoboard’s digital dashboard. They pricing starts at $44 for 1 dashboard and 3 users.
