## Business Intelligence Alerts

A lot of businesses still use dedicated slack channels, dashboards, standup meetings, GitHub, notion and a plethora 
of tools to get a pulse of WTF is happening across increasingly distributed landscape, that we all work and live in.
This work is urgent and necessary but often time consuming and not optimised. Compiling business intelligence alerts,
Github notifications, dashboard pings and others can take you away from the important less urgent tasks. 

Speaking to 100s of founders, one of the main issues is notification blindness. Maybe you’ve never heard this 
but I’m sure straight away you know what I mean when you see that little red bubble with 3 digits, this 
has me nopeing out till later, that kind of notification overload has meant I’ve missed some pretty crucial things in
the past, one I still remember, a particularly high value client needing help, being unintentionally ignored and churning.

We've been working on a solution, 100% custom to your business email alerts. Skip to how to setup them up free,

### What Are Email Digests in EchoDash?

Dashboards are great — but for many they aren’t customisable enough, you still gotta tab jump and then stitch this together.

[**EchoDash Email Digests**](https://echodash.com/docs/notifications/email-digests) gives you a curated summary from across your entire software stack. You
choose the source, the event, and the frequency. Kind of like the emails you get from everyone
else but one that’s entirely about your business.

EchoDash is already your feed for everything: GitHub commits, Stripe payments, Notion comments, downtime alerts 
— all live, filterable, and searchable. You want an easily digestible **summary**.

That’s what Email Digests do:

- Pull events from multiple tools
- Cut down on notification overload
- Group them into a clean daily or weekly report
- Control when and what you’re alerted to

Think of it as **your daily command centre update**. Basically you can automate your business alerts with email digests.

### Why Use Email Digests?

The most common thing we’ve heard in every founder would love to reduce notification overload. Pretty much had 
one or more of these issues:

- Checking 12 tools daily just to get a pulse on what’s happening
- Relying on Slack bots and miss 90% of what matters
- Drowning in emails that aren’t summarised or structured
- Missing important activity because no one checks business dashboards
- Slack notifications not working

Customised email digests solve all of these problems.

### What’s Inside a Digest Email?

Each email digest includes:

- Top-line stats (event volume, sources)
- **Summary header** (number of events, active sources)
- **Grouped sections** by source (Stripe, Notion, Cloudflare, etc.)
- **Each event's title, timestamp, and top-level data**
- **Direct links** to jump into the feed and view the full event

It’s all signal, no noise.

### Managing a Digest Email

Change your mind later? No problem.

You can:

- Revisit the **Email Digests** settings tab anytime
- Add/remove sources and event types
- Change delivery frequency
- Or hit **“unsubscribe”** from any digest email to stop them entirely

### What is a Webhook Notification?

It’s a question that would have stumped me not so long ago, honestly before working with Jack I had no idea WTF a webhook was.
let alone a web hook notification. Basically what makes them so cool is they’re packets of data sent out from any service you 
use but that allows you to clip, cut and trim and format to give you only the data you need. 

Webhook Notifications are a way to get alerts from services that don’t even have APIs. 
Webhook notifications are basically files with data that EchoDash can turn into meaningful insights.
Better yet even I, a code illiterate, can integrate a Webhook into EchoDash, so they’re very easy to use to build your custom emails,
custom dashboards and of course to utilise EchoDash’s free business dashboard feed.

### Slack vs Email Notification?

Slack is a pretty useful tool and we’ve sang it’s praises, most teams we spoke to use it for at least something and many use
dedicated slack channels to intake their webhook notifications. Which can be great if all those alerts are meaningful and don’t
overwhelm of notification overload you. 

However in many cases these dedicated slack channels work very well for the first months
but as your business grows so does the noise, and we’ve heard how often “slack notifications not working”. Our Email digests
Can solve both of these issues.

### Why Email Digests Work?

We didn’t build digests because email is cool. We built them because **not everyone wants another Slack ping** 
or lives in a dashboard. Email has been around for more than 50 years because it’s pretty darn flexible and  of course
path dependance, alas we all still (until AI is good enough to be a real PA) need to use emails.

Most of you we spoke to wanted to reduce notification overload with a readable, one glance-and-go update that’s **curated**.

That’s what we built and we love it (and use it personally because:)

- You don’t need to be in the app — info comes to you
- You can scan, not search — summaries beat dashboards for quick updates
- You set the schedule — daily, weekly, or only the most critical updates (so ad hoc when they occur.)
- You choose what’s relevant.

## How Does this Apply to Me? Use Cases by Role.

### Real-World Example: Cutting Dashboard Time by 10H a Week.

A solo founder we closely worked with went from:

- “I spend the 2 hours of every day checking Stripe, Notion, Slack, Matomo, and my inbox...
 just to see what broke overnight”

To:

- “One email digest at 9.30AM, and I know exactly what’s happened, what needs a reply, and if anything’s broken.”

That’s **10+ hours back every week.**

## Why This Works

- **You don’t need to be in the EchoDash app** 
- **You can scan, not search**
- **You set the schedule** 
- **You choose the content** 

This is the antidote to notification fatigue and inbox chaos.

Email Digests are especially useful if you:

- **Use 5+ SaaS tools** and waste time switching tabs
- **Run async or distributed teams** and need visibility without micromanaging
- **Work in CS, dev, ops, product or marketing** and want a single view of what matters
- **Manage clients or properties** and don’t want to log into 100 instances a day
