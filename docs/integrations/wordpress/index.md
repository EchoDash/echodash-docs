Merge fields let you include dynamic data in your events. Format: `{source:field}`

Common merge field sources:

- `{user:email}` - Current user's email
- `{user:display_name}` - User's display name  
- `{post:title}` - Current post title
- `{post:id}` - Post ID
- `{order:total}` - Order total (WooCommerce)
- `{subscription:status}` - Subscription status

You can click the dropdown in the editor to see a list of available merge fields for the trigger.
